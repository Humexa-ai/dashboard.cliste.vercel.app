# Clerk Dashboard Configuration Fix

Your deployment is redirecting to Clerk's hosted sign-in page (`musical-insect-32.accounts.dev`) instead of your custom sign-in page.

## üîß Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Disable Clerk's Account Portal

1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Select your application
3. Navigate to **"User & Authentication"** ‚Üí **"Portal"** (or **"Account Portal"**)
4. Find the toggle/switch that says **"Account Portal"** or **"User Portal"**
5. **Turn it OFF/Disable it**
6. Save your changes

This prevents Clerk from redirecting users to their hosted authentication pages.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your **dashboard-cliste-vercel-app** project
3. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_bXVzaWNhbC1pbnNlY3QtMzIuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_lMy2gFUHMwiU6rjtUodWewN5dWN0tGaftHbeC39OdC
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

**Important:** Make sure to:
- Select **Production, Preview, and Development** environments for each variable
- Copy the EXACT values from your `.env.local` file
- Click **Save** after adding each variable

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to the **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click the three dots (**...**) on the latest deployment
3. Select **Redeploy**
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Step 4: Test

Visit **https://dashboard-cliste-vercel-app.vercel.app** and you should see your custom sign-in page instead of Clerk's hosted page.
